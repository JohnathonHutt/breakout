# breakout
An HTML5 canvas breakout game based on the MDN tutorial (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Tutorials/2D_Breakout_game_pure_JavaScript) w/ some modifications.

Bricks require two hits to break - turn red after initial hit.

Ball starts out 25% faster than tutorial and increases by 5% of initial value every time it hits the paddle. Ball resets to initial speed after each miss.
